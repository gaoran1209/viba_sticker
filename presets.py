STICKER_PRESETS = {
    "Inner Animal": """Create a stylized illustration sticker based on the reference image. The design must feature the character and a randomly selected animal (excluding snakes).
Text Requirements:
Top text (Bold): 'Opps!'
Bottom text (Small font): 'Inner Animal • [Insert a randomly chosen personality adjective]'
Visual Requirements:
Character Consistency: Faithfully reproduce the character's facial features and clothing from the reference image without modification.
Pose Instructions: If the original pose is static or lacks energy, reimagine it as a dramatic, high-fashion editorial pose (seated or standing) in the style of Johnny Dufort. If the original pose already has high visual impact, keep it unchanged.
Interaction: The character should be dynamically positioned beside the animal, sharing an intense, editorial-style gaze.
Style: The overall aesthetic must be avant-garde, cinematic, and edgy.""",

    "Raw nature": """Strictly maintain the exact facial features, identity, and original clothing of the model from the reference image without any alterations to them. For the model's pose: if the original pose is seated, or if its inherent tension is low, then it must be reinterpreted into a high-fashion editorial pose in the distinctive style of Johnny Dufort. This new pose can be either seated or standing, as long as it achieves significant dramatic tension and impact. However, if the original pose already possesses substantial dramatic tension and visual impact, then the pose should be strictly maintained as is. The model is now interacting dynamically with a randomly chosen animal (excluding snakes) suitable for a high-fashion editorial, positioned by her side, sharing intense, high-fashion eye contact. 
- Top-Left Sticker: Add a graphic fashion sticker in the top-left corner. It should feature a stylized illustration of the model and the randomly chosen animal. The top text is bold "Opps!"; the bottom text (in smaller font) is "Inner Animal • A randomly chosen personality word". 
- Film Effects: Apply a Y2K film style with heavy grain and 35mm texture over the entire image. Add a 75% opacity vignette effect with "chemically damaged" and light-leaked film edges around the frame. 
- Overall Tone: The composition should be avant-garde, cinematic, and retain the edgy, high-fashion feel inspired by Johnny Dufort, while strictly adhering to the original model's appearance and attire.""",

    "OOTD": """Fashion sticker set of the person from the uploaded image, real-life high-fashion style. The character features a 1.5x oversized head for a stylish, playful "big head" aesthetic. The image is a deconstructed "paper doll" layout consisting of exactly three distinct pieces arranged in a vertical column: 1.  Top Piece:  Just the oversized head with a chic facial expression. 2.  Middle Piece:  The upper body torso including the arms and hands, wearing the exact designer outfit and accessories shown in the reference image. 3.  Bottom Piece:  The lower body consisting strictly of the waist, legs, and shoes only, with no hands or arms present. Maintain 100% character consistency in face, hair, and outfit. High-end fashion photography style, stickers placed on a minimalist Jil Sander-style textured fabric background. Soft natural lighting, studio quality, 8k resolution, clean white die-cut borders around each of the three pieces.""",

    "FishView #35mm": """A high-fashion editorial shot through a vintage 35mm fisheye lens, with the subject naturally interacting with the camera. Maintain strict character consistency: exact facial features, hair, and identical clothing from the reference. The subject is leaning into the frame with candid movement and a proportional, natural head size. The pose is dynamic and chic, paired with a calm, neutral Guy Bourdin-style gaze. Features a professional film enlargement look with sophisticated color transitions and analog warmth. Direct flash creates high contrast with deep, rich shadows. Heavily infused with dark salt-and-pepper film grain and a gritty analog texture. Incorporate a slight peripheral camera shake and dynamic trailing motion blur at the circular edges, along with noticeable chromatic aberration. The final result is a professional, spontaneous fashion snapshot with a clinical yet raw film""",

    "Selfcast": """Fashion editorial photography by Johnny Dufort. Character consistency: Maintain the exact background, lighting, and environment from the original photo. The person from the original photo is positioned in the center, maintaining identical facial features, identity, and chic temperament. 
The Addition: The person leans naturally and stylishly against a vertical stack of 5 vintage CRT televisions integrated seamlessly into the existing scene. 
The 5 TV Screens (Displaying consistent identity): 
- Screen 1: Extreme close-up of lips and makeup. 
- Screen 2: Detailed shot of hands, nails, and jewelry. 
- Screen 3: Close-up of eyes and expression. 
- Screen 4: Detailed shot of shoes and lower garment. 
- Screen 5: A silhouette or specific body posture detail. 
Texture & Aesthetics: Classic Fujifilm aesthetic. The TV screens feature vintage CRT texture with subtle grain, faint RGB scanlines, and slight color fading.  High-contrast lighting, avant-garde atmosphere, 90s lo-fi tech aesthetic. Strictly preserve the original background elements"""
