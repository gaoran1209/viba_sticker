I have analyzed your request and the codebase. Since `viba_sticker` is a Discord bot (outbound connection), it won't conflict with OpenClaw's ports. To ensure isolation and easy management, I recommend using **Docker**.

Here is the migration plan:

### 1. Containerization (Local)
Create Docker configuration to package the application.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Define the Python environment (Python 3.10-slim), install dependencies, and set the entry point.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Orchestrate the container, handle auto-restart (`restart: always`), and load environment variables.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Automate deployment so you don't have to manually SSH.
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**: A workflow that triggers on push to `main`.
  - Connects to EC2 via SSH.
  - Pulls the latest code.
  - Rebuilds and restarts the container using Docker Compose.

### 3. Server Setup (Instructions for you)
You will need to perform a one-time setup on your EC2 instance:
- Install Docker and Docker Compose (if not already installed).
- Clone the repository to the server.
- Create a `.env` file with your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Configure GitHub Secrets (`EC2_SSH_KEY`, `EC2_HOST`, etc.) to allow the Action to log in.

This approach ensures:
- **Isolation**: `viba_sticker` runs in its own container, not affecting OpenClaw's Node.js environment.
- **Cost Saving**: Runs on your existing EC2.
- **Automation**: "Push to deploy" workflow replaces Railway.

I will now create the necessary files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) and then guide you through the server-side commands.
